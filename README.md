Final Year Project
- Project Title: Information Extraction from Bibliography Data
- Utilised data analytics and data mining techniques to extract valuable insights and knowledge
from DBLP Dataset.
- Created a visualisation web application using D3.js and Chart.js for users to query and gain
insights from the DBLP data.
- Researched and implemented various machine learning and link prediction algorithms to
predict who an author may co-author with in future.
- Enhanced the accuracy of link prediction algorithms using the concept of homophily.
- Built a python link prediction program using the enhanced link prediction algorithm in order to
predict who an author may co-author with in future.
